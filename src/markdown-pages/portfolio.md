content: "The portfolio you're browing right now, has been an evlolving, personal project of mine since 2017. From the first version, to the latest one that you're browsing, I've used React and Gatsby to showcase my professional experiences and contributions. After upgrading/refactoring the site with Gatsby 2 (from 1.0), and as a supporter of Gatsby CMS from day 1, I have been accepted as a maintaner of the platform on GitHub."
